# Project Plan

Current improvement plan (ordered):

1) Improve Playwright detection and install flow (Node + Python) with clear checks and an "Install" action.
2) Make codegen output -> project file more robust (append + format + dedupe).
3) Tool window UX polish: clearer states, inline errors/warnings, context-aware buttons, shortcuts.
4) Locator intelligence: prioritize data-testid, role/aria, text+role, stable CSS fallback.
5) Auto-detect target language (TS/JS/Python) per project and persist selection.
6) Packaging polish: metadata, changelog, description, screenshots, Marketplace-ready.
